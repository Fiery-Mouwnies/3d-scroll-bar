/*
  IMPORTANT CORRECTION:
  Do NOT force `overflow: auto !important` on the html or body tags.
  GSAP's ScrollTrigger `pin: true` functionality relies on the browser's
  natural scroll behavior to work correctly. Forcing overflow can break
  its internal calculations.

  The browser will automatically add a scrollbar when the content height
  (your multiple <section> elements) is greater than the viewport height.

/* You can keep this rule if you want to prevent horizontal scrollbars */
